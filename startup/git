 1. Temporarily Disable SSL Verification (Quick Test)

    Disable SSL verification for Git globally. Note that this reduces security and should only be a temporary troubleshooting step:
    bash

git config --global http.sslVerify false

If it works, re-enable it later (git config --global http.sslVerify true) and investigate other solutions
.
